## Calculator
A simple calculator written in vanilla ES6 javascript.

This project was originally thrown together on codepen, but in an effort to improve it, I pulled the code into a local npm package and completely re-wrote the javascript using real deal, test first, TDD with jest. It was awesome. Then I added babel and webpack in order to bundle it up and show it off. Still needs some work, but basic functionality is there.

## TODO:

[x] Mobile friendly
[ ] Floating point support.
